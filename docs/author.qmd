## About {.unnumbered}

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
I’m a Professor of Pharmacology with a strong passion for Biostatistics. I have many years of experience in research and teaching at higher-education institutions. Throughout my journey, I have developed a solid foundation in biostatistics and gained proficiency in different statistical software, including `R, SPSS, Minitab, GraphPad Prism, Jamovi, and more.` I created this website to share the knowledge and practical insights I have acquired, with the goal of supporting others interested in learning biostatistics. I hope you find the content both useful and informative.
