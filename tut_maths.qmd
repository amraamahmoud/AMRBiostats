-   This section is intended to revise some of the basic mathematical concepts that are commonly encountered in biostatistics. However, it is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to mathematics, but rather a refresher for those who may have forgotten some of the basic concepts. The main topics covered here include basic algebra and calculus.
